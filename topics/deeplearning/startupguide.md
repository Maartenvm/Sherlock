# Start  up guide

This guide gives you the necessary steps to prepare for the first Sherlock sprint for the team
working on the "Deep  leanring for computer vision" topic.

1. Read the [topic description document](https://github.com/NLeSC/Sherlock/blob/master/topics/deeplearning/deeplearning4computervision.md).If you are new to the field, it is also useful to look at the links for deep leanring and convolutional neural networks.
2. Watch video introduciton(s)
  * *If you are new to Machine Learning (ML)*, watch this [gentle introduction to ML video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOm1zA_Cats) (~ 15 mins. w/o the questions).
  * *If you are new to using deep learning for computer vision* watch this [video tutorial] ().
