# Start  up guide

This guide gives you the necessary steps to prepare for the first Sherlock sprint for the team
working on the "Deep  leanring for computer vision" topic.

1. Read the [topic description document](https://github.com/NLeSC/Sherlock/blob/master/topics/deeplearning/deeplearning4computervision.md).If you are new to the field, it is also useful to look at the links for deep leanring and convolutional neural networks. Also, don't miss the link to the cool Berkeley Vision lab online demo.
2. Watch video introduciton(s)
  * *If you are new to Machine Learning (ML)*, watch this [gentle introduction to ML video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOm1zA_Cats) (~ 15 mins. w/o the questions).
  * *If you are new deep learning (for computer vision)* watch this [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlhFWT7vAEw) for Oxford CS students (~ 50 mins.).
3. Make sure you have Python working on your machine.
4. *(conditional) Chose a use case from the [topic description decument](https://github.com/NLeSC/Sherlock/blob/master/topics/deeplearning/deeplearning4computervision.md)*
5. Read the paper(s) for the (*chosen*) use case(s). 
 * For the car categorisation use case follow the original link from the topic descritpion or get it from [OneDrive](https://nlesc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/e_ranguelova_esciencecenter_nl/Documents/Sherlock/DeepLearning4ComputerVision/Papers/CarCategorization.pdf). 
 * For the gender&age categorization use case ase follow the original link from the topic descritpion or get it from [OneDrive](https://nlesc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/e_ranguelova_esciencecenter_nl/Documents/Sherlock/DeepLearning4ComputerVision/Papers/CNN_AgeGenderEstimation.pdf).
