# First sprint plan

## Day 1
Learn about deep learning and using Caffe

* [A Deep Learning Toturial: from Perceptrons to Deep Networks](http://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks)
* [DIY Deep Learning with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit?pli=1#slide=id.gc2fcdcce7_216_101) tutorial with the hands on notebooks
*  Chose use case and read paper/download models and data (if not done)

## Day 2
Use Caffe with avaialble models
 * run pre-trained networks
 * modify models and study result
 * experiment with fine-tuning 

## Day 3
Produce integration code and lessons learnt page
* Output to Hansken output file code(?)
* Prepare Lessons learned page
