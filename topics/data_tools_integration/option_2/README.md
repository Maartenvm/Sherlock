============

Apache Thrift
-------------

To understand how to use Apache Thrift you should check out its [tutorial](https://thrift.apache.org/tutorial/) and the examples in [apache thrift github](https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/master/tutorial).
For example, it contains [thrift nodejs examples](https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/master/lib/nodejs/examples).



Protocol Buffers
-----------------------

It is Google's data interchange format. On its [gitHub repository](https://github.com/google/protobuf) there is information for [C++ installation - Unix](https://github.com/google/protobuf#c-installation---unix), but also for [Java and Python](https://github.com/google/protobuf#java-and-python-installation). We recommend you to look inside [examples directory](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/examples) to understand a bit how it works. A compact description is also available [here](http://www.scriptol.com/programming/protocol-buffers-tutorial.php). For more [detailed tutorials we recommend the google developers page for protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/tutorials?hl=en).


ZeroMQ
------

[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) is a distributed messaging protocol which allows you to connect your code in any language. To better understand it you should read the [100 words description](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all) or its [core documentation](http://zeromq.org/intro:read-the-manual). There is also a [nice blog post to explain its architecture](http://www.aosabook.org/en/zeromq.html). ZeroMQ can be obtained as a [stable release](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) or [development branch](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq).
